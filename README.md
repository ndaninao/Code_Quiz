# Code_Quiz
*Not sure how to change the pages so that each question shows up on a new page… I feel like there is a code for this but I wasn’t able to find anything when I was googling and my guess is, it isn’t a switch between separate HTML files.

*I’m also struggling with calling the function, I’m not sure how or when to do this. 

*Don’t get me started on Storage…. This is confusing. How do I link up the input with the storage when clicking? 

*I’m also still struggling with getting a button to work correctly. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. 

It would be really nice to have someone sit down and review my code and fill in where I am missing so that I can see where I am making errors in thinking. 

Right now, it’s go ‘do’ and good luck. It feels like asking a 1-week old infant to walk…..
